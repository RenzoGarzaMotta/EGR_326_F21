 *Description:
 *  This part controls the RGB LED sequence using a timer peripheral in the MSP432.
 *  -Use the three on-board RGB LEDs with one external pushbutton.
 *  -The pushbutton should be triggered by interrupts.
 *  -On RESET, the LEDs should be OFF.
 *  -When the pushbutton is press and held down the RGB LED should follow the sequence
 *   RED->GREEN->BLUE with a 1sec On-Time for each color (use SysTick).
 *  -This sequence should repeat as long as the pushbutton is depressed. When the
 *   pushbutton is released the sequencing pauses with the current LED remaining ON.
 *  -Upon the next press of the pushbutton, the LED sequence will start up again in
 *   reverse order and continue for as long as the pushbutton is held down.
