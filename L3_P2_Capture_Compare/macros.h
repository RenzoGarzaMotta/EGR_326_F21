 *Description:
 *  This part will use a second pushbutton in combination with the first to flash the selected LED on
 *  and off in 0.5 second intervals. Both the SysTick and each pushbutton  should be triggered using
 *  interrupts.
 *  -Modify Part II code so that the first pushbutton will select the LED colot. The second pushbutton
 *   is then used to turn that color LED on and off. (Both buttons should be triggered by interrupts.)
 *  -Selectr a color LED by sequencing through the colors with the first pushbutton. When the second
 *   pushbutton is pressed and held, the selected colot LED flashed on and off every 0.5s. When released,
 *   the LED stays lit with the last selected color.
