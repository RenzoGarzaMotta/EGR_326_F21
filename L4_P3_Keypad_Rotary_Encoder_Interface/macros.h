 *Description:
 *  This part requires the user to enter a value using the keypad and then turning the rotary
 *  encoder until the absolution number of pulses (abosilute value of CW - CCW) exceeds the
 *  keypad value. If this occurs, the RED led should be illuminated. Pressing the pushbutton
 *  switch resets the count and turns off the LED.
 *
 *  -Prompt the user for a pulse range
 *  -Monitor the rotary encoder as in part II to keep track of number of counts (CW and CCW)
 *  -Illuminate a RED LED if the CW count is met (but not exceeded)
 *  -Illuminate a BLUE LED if the CCW count is met (but not exceeded)
 *  -Nothing then will happen until the user presses the pushbutton switch to reset the count and turn off the LED.
 *  -The program should return to step one of part 3 upon the button being pressed.
